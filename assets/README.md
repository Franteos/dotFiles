# WELCOME!!
This environment has been developed to facilitate daily tasks and not to waste time on unnecessary things. It also incorporates small scripts to secure your computer.

## SECURE
As a cybersecurity student, I have developed 2 scripts that secure the computer. One is in charge of the networking and the other of the SSH service.
`sudo ~/secureOS.sh`
`sudo ~/secureSSH.sh`

## ZSH
Oh-My-ZSH has been installed so that the icons are already configured. 
The most important aliases are:
`c command` --> CheatSheet of that command.
`myip` --> Know Public IP.
`copy file` --> Copy file content to clipboard.

## TMUX
TMUX has been configured all by me, with the possibility to use mouse and allows 256 colors.
Most important commands:
`Ctrl+b v` --> Split Vertical
`Ctrl+b h` --> Split Horizontal
`Ctrl+b c` --> New session
`Ctrl+b Ctrl+b` --> Swap Pane

## NVIM
To have NVIM scripts and plugins already integrated, I have installed Astro Nvim.
Most important commands:
`:q` --> Normal quit
`:q!` --> Quit without save
`:wq` --> Save and quit

## EXTRA
Remember that this is developed by a single person. There may be some bugs, so feel free to contact me:

Thank you very much for using my script <3
